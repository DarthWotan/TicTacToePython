## TicTacToe 
This is a simple TicTacToe program.             
You can play alone against an AI or against a friend. 
Choose the mode and difficulty (if alone) and start playing.    
You only need any program to execute Python-Code!   
**_Have fun!_**  

### Note
The programm for the console is the first approach for a TicTacToe game within the console. In this file I haven't used much algorithms, so it is not very efficient. You can see this file as a "prototype" for the final implementation.
